SCIFIO ImageIO plugin
---------------------

This package provides an ITK ImageIO plugin that uses SCIFIO
to read and write supported life sciences file formats.

The SCIFIO ImageIO plugin was developed by Gaetan Lehmann, Mark Hiner,
Curtis Rueden, Melissa Linkert and Matt McCormick. Development of this
module was funded in part by the [FARSIGHT
project](http://farsight-toolkit.org/), as well as the [Open Microscopy
Environment](http://openmicroscopy.org/).

Special thanks to Alex Gouaillard, Sebastien Barre, Luis Ibanez and
Jim Miller for fixes and suggestions.

For further details, including usage instructions, see the [Bio-Formats
ITK page](http://openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats/users/itk).

For general troubleshooting issues using this plugin, please e-mail the [SCIFIO
mailing list](mailto:scifio@scif.io).

Any questions about the capabilities of Bio-Formats can be
[directed to the OME team](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/community).
